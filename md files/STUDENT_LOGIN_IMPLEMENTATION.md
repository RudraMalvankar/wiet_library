FROM Student s
INNER JOIN Member m ON s.MemberNo = m.MemberNo

## 📝 Session Variables Available

After successful login, these variables are available throughout the student portal:

```php

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting

### Problem: "Invalid email or password"

**Solution:**

- Verify email exists in Student table
- Check Member.Status = 'Active'
- Ensure password is exactly `123456`
- Check database connection

### Problem: "Your library membership has expired"

**Solution:**

- Check Student.ValidTill date
- Update ValidTill to future date in admin panel
- Or set ValidTill to NULL for no expiry

### Problem: "Session expired" after few minutes

**Solution:**

- This is normal after 30 minutes of inactivity
- Students should login again
- Adjust timeout in `student_session_check.php` if needed

### Problem: Student can't access pages

**Solution:**

- Verify `student_session_check.php` exists
- Check session variables are set
- Clear browser cache
- Check browser console for errors

## 📧 Email Requirements

Students need a valid email address to login. Email should:

- Be unique per student
- Follow proper email format (name@domain.com)
- Be entered in Student.Email field during registration

**Note:** Admin panel already saves email - no changes needed to admin functionality!

---

## 🔄 Logout Functionality

Students can logout by:

1. Clicking logout button in student portal (if available)
2. Direct access: `http://localhost/wiet_lib/student/student_logout.php`
3. Session will auto-expire after 30 minutes

---

## 💡 Tips for Admins

1. **Always enter student email** during registration
2. Password is always `123456` - tell students this
3. Check Member status is "Active" for student login to work
4. ValidTill date should be future date or NULL
5. Students can't change password (simplified system)

## 📞 Support

For issues:

1. Check PHP error log: `c:\xampp\php\logs\php_error_log`
2. Check Apache error log: `c:\xampp\apache\logs\error.log`
3. Check MySQL via phpMyAdmin: `http://localhost/phpmyadmin`
