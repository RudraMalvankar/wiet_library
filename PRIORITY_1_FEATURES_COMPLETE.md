## ⚠️ PENDING FEATURE

### 5. 📧 **Email Notification System** - ❌ NOT STARTED

**Impact:** High | **Effort:** Medium | **Status:** 0% Complete

**Why Not Completed:**

- Requires external dependency (PHPMailer library)
- Needs SMTP server configuration
- Testing requires real email server
- Time constraint (prioritized other 4 features)

**What's Needed:**

1. Install PHPMailer via Composer: `composer require phpmailer/phpmailer`
2. Configure SMTP settings in `admin/settings.php`
3. Create email templates:
   - Overdue reminder
   - Due date alert (3 days before)
   - Event confirmation
   - Password reset OTP
   - Reservation ready notification
4. Create scheduled task for daily overdue checks
5. Test email delivery with Gmail SMTP

**Estimated Time:** 2-3 days

**Workaround:**

- Password reset currently shows OTP on screen (demo mode)
- Can be switched to email once PHPMailer is configured
- All other systems work without email
