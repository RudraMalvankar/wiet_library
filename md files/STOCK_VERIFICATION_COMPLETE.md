## 📸 Camera Fix Summary

### ✅ Fixed Issues in `circulation.php`

Fixed all 3 camera scanning functions:

#### 1. **startMemberScan()** (Lines 1938-1982)
- ✅ Removed complex camera device selection
- ✅ Simplified constraints to direct object
- ✅ Moved `window.startMemberScan` outside function
- ✅ Added proper error handling for loading overlay

#### 2. **startBookScan()** (Lines 2030-2074)
- ✅ Same fixes as above
- ✅ Increased resolution to 640x480
- ✅ Proper global scope assignment

#### 3. **startReturnScan()** (Lines 2120-2165)
- ✅ Same pattern of fixes
- ✅ All camera functions now working

### What Was Wrong:
```javascript
// ❌ BEFORE (BROKEN):
async function startMemberScan() {
    window.startMemberScan = startMemberScan; // Inside function!
    await populateCameraSelect('memberCameraSelect'); // Complex & failing
    // ...
}

// ✅ AFTER (FIXED):
async function startMemberScan() {
    const constraints = { 
        video: { facingMode: 'environment', width: { ideal: 640 }, height: { ideal: 480 } }
    };
    // ... rest of function
}
window.startMemberScan = startMemberScan; // Outside function!
```

## 🗄️ Database Integration

### API Endpoint: `admin/api/books.php?action=lookup`

**Request:**
```
GET /admin/api/books.php?action=lookup&accNo=ACC001001
```

**Response:**
```json
{
    "success": true,
    "data": {
        "AccNo": "ACC001001",
        "Title": "Introduction to Programming",
        "Author1": "John Smith",
        "Author2": null,
