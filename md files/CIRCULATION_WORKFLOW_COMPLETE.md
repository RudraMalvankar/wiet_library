   - Visual feedback with success/error messages

2. **Book Search & Availability Check**
   - Manual entry via input field (`#accNo`)
   - Barcode/QR code scanning

## Scanning Infrastructure

### ZXing Library Integration

- **CDN:** `https://unpkg.com/@zxing/library@latest/umd/index.min.js`
- **Code Readers:**
  - `memberCodeReader` - BrowserQRCodeReader (QR codes only)
  - `bookCodeReader` - BrowserMultiFormatReader (all barcodes/QR)
  - `returnCodeReader` - BrowserMultiFormatReader (all barcodes/QR)

### Camera Controls

Each scanning area has:
- Start Scan button (requests camera permission, starts video stream)
- Stop Scan button (stops camera, releases stream)
- Simulate Scan button (for testing without physical QR/barcode)
- Video element for live camera feed
- Canvas element for processing
- Placeholder overlay when camera inactive
- Scanning overlay with feedback animation

### Supported Scan Formats

- **Member ID:** QR codes (JSON or plain text containing member number)
- **Book AccNo:** Barcodes (Code128, EAN, UPC) and QR codes
- **Return AccNo:** Barcodes and QR codes

## Visual Feedback System

### Success Messages

- Green background with ✓ checkmark icon
- Examples:
  - "✓ Member found: John Doe"
  - "✓ Book available: Introduction to Programming"
  - "✓ Circulation found: Advanced Database Systems"

### Error Messages

- Red background with ⚠️ warning icon
- Examples:
  - "Member 123456 not found!"
  - "Book is not available for issue! Current status: Issued"
  - "No active circulation found for AccNo: ACC001001"
  - "⚠️ Book is overdue by 5 days. Fine: ₹10.00"

### Loading States

- Spinner icon with "Loading..." text
- Used during API calls to show progress

---

## State Management

### Global Variables

```javascript
let selectedMember = null;      // Currently selected member object
let selectedBook = null;        // Currently selected book object
let returnBookData = null;      // Current return circulation object
let memberStream = null;        // Camera stream for member scan
let bookStream = null;          // Camera stream for book scan
let returnStream = null;        // Camera stream for return scan
let memberCodeReader = null;    // ZXing reader for member QR
let bookCodeReader = null;      // ZXing reader for book barcode
let returnCodeReader = null;    // ZXing reader for return barcode
```

### Form Reset Logic

**Issue Form:**
- Clear `selectedMember` and `selectedBook`
- Reset input fields: `memberNo`, `accNo`, `remarks`
- Hide info cards: `memberInfo`, `bookInfo`
- Disable issue button

**Return Form:**
- Clear `returnBookData`
- Reset input fields: `returnAccNo`, `returnRemarks`
- Reset condition dropdown to "Good"
- Hide info cards: `returnBookInfo`, `fineCalculator`
- Disable return button

---

## Data Refresh Strategy

After successful issue:
1. Refresh statistics cards (`loadStatistics()`)
2. Refresh active circulations table (`loadActiveCirculations()`)
3. Reset issue form

After successful return:
1. Refresh statistics cards (`loadStatistics()`)
2. Refresh active circulations table (`loadActiveCirculations()`)
3. Refresh return history table (`loadReturnHistory()`)
4. Reset return form

## Known Limitations

2. **QR Format:** Member QR codes should contain MemberNo (plain text or JSON)
3. **Barcode Format:** Book barcodes should match AccNo exactly
4. **Fine Calculation:** Simple ₹2/day calculation, no complex rules
5. **Concurrent Scans:** Only one camera can be active per tab at a time

---

## Future Enhancements

1. **Auto-focus:** Automatically focus input fields after successful scan
2. **Sound Feedback:** Beep on successful scan
3. **Vibration:** Haptic feedback on mobile devices
4. **Batch Returns:** Select multiple books to return at once
5. **Print Receipt:** Generate printable receipt after issue/return
6. **SMS/Email:** Send notification to member after transaction
7. **Offline Mode:** Queue transactions when offline, sync later
8. **Analytics:** Track scanning success rate and performance

## Files Modified

1. **`admin/circulation.php`**
   - Fixed `searchMember()` to use correct API parameter (`memberNo` instead of `id`)
   - Fixed `searchBook()` to use `lookup` action instead of `get`
   - Updated `issueBook()` to send JSON payload instead of FormData
   - Updated `returnBook()` to send JSON payload with proper field names
   - Enhanced error handling with visual feedback
   - Added input validation
   - Improved loading states and user feedback
   - Added URL encoding for API parameters

---

## Deployment Notes

1. **HTTPS Required:** Camera access requires HTTPS in production (localhost exempt)
2. **PHP Extensions:** Ensure PDO_MySQL extension enabled
3. **Database:** All circulation tables must exist (Circulation, Return, Member, Holding, Books)
4. **Permissions:** Web server needs read/write to session directory
5. **CORS:** Not needed if API and frontend on same domain

---

## Support & Maintenance

For issues or questions:
- Check browser console for JavaScript errors
- Check PHP error logs for server-side issues
- Verify API endpoints return correct JSON format
- Test with manual input first, then try scanning
- Ensure camera permissions granted in browser settings

---

**Implementation Complete! ✅**

The entire circulation workflow is now fully functional with proper API integration, scanning capabilities, and comprehensive error handling.
