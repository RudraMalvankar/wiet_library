## üîç **ISSUES FOUND & FIXED**

### **Before Update: 4 Sections with Dummy Data**

| Section                               | Lines | Issue                                                                         | Status   |
| ------------------------------------- | ----- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------- |

---

## üéØ **WHAT WAS CHANGED**

### **1. Quick Stats - Now 100% Database-Driven**

**Previous Issue:**

- Fallback to dummy data: `books_issued: 3, books_due: 1, pending_fines: 0, recommendations: 2`

**New Implementation:**

```php
// ‚úÖ Books issued and due soon from Circulation table
$quick_stats_query = "
    SELECT
        COUNT(DISTINCT c.CirculationID) as books_issued,
        COUNT(DISTINCT CASE WHEN DATEDIFF(c.DueDate, CURDATE()) <= 7
            AND DATEDIFF(c.DueDate, CURDATE()) >= 0
            THEN c.CirculationID END) as books_due
    FROM Circulation c
    WHERE c.MemberNo = :member_no
    AND c.ReturnDate IS NULL
";

// ‚úÖ Pending fines from Return + FinePayments tables
$fines_query = "
    SELECT COALESCE(SUM(r.Fine - COALESCE(fp.AmountPaid, 0)), 0) as pending_fines
    FROM `Return` r
    LEFT JOIN (
        SELECT TransactionID, SUM(AmountPaid) as AmountPaid
        FROM FinePayments
        GROUP BY TransactionID
    ) fp ON r.ReturnID = fp.TransactionID
    WHERE r.MemberNo = :member_no
    AND r.Fine > COALESCE(fp.AmountPaid, 0)
";

// ‚úÖ Recommendations count from Books table (student's branch)
$recommendations_query = "
    SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT b.CallNo) as recommendations
    FROM Books b
    INNER JOIN Holding h ON b.CallNo = h.CallNo
    WHERE b.Subject LIKE CONCAT('%', :branch, '%')
    AND h.Status = 'Available'
    LIMIT 100
";
```

**Exception Handling:**

- Now falls back to session data (`$_SESSION['books_issued']`) instead of dummy numbers
- Empty array for `$upcoming_due` instead of fake books

---

### **2. Recent Activity - From ActivityLog Table**

**Previous Issue:**

- Hardcoded array with dummy activities:
  - "Book Issued" - "Data Structures and Algorithms" - "2025-09-20"
  - "Book Returned" - "Computer Networks" - "2025-09-18"
  - "Book Renewed" - "Operating Systems" - "2025-09-15"

**New Implementation:**

```php
// ‚úÖ Fetch from ActivityLog table
$activity_query = "
    SELECT
        al.Action as action,
        COALESCE(b.Title, al.Details) as book,
        al.Timestamp as date
    FROM ActivityLog al
    LEFT JOIN Circulation c ON al.RelatedID = c.CirculationID
        AND al.Action IN ('Book Issued', 'Book Returned', 'Book Renewed')
    LEFT JOIN Holding h ON c.AccNo = h.AccNo
    LEFT JOIN Books b ON h.CallNo = b.CallNo
    WHERE al.MemberNo = :member_no
    AND al.Action IN ('Book Issued', 'Book Returned', 'Book Renewed',
        'Profile Updated', 'Password Changed')
    ORDER BY al.Timestamp DESC
    LIMIT 10
";
```

**Features:**

- Shows **last 10 activities** from ActivityLog table
- Joins with Circulation ‚Üí Holding ‚Üí Books to get book titles
- Falls back to `al.Details` if book title not found
- Shows "Account Created" placeholder if no activity exists

---

### **3. Notifications - Dynamically Generated**

**Previous Issue:**

- Hardcoded array with dummy notifications:
  - "Book 'Database Management Systems' is due in 2 days"
  - "New arrivals: 15 books added to Computer Science section"
  - "Your recommendation for 'Clean Code' has been approved"

**New Implementation:**

```php
// ‚úÖ Dynamic notifications from multiple sources

// 1. Check for overdue books
$overdue_query = "
    SELECT COUNT(*) as overdue_count
    FROM Circulation c
    WHERE c.MemberNo = :member_no
    AND c.ReturnDate IS NULL
    AND c.DueDate < CURDATE()
";

// 2. Check for books due soon (within 3 days)
$due_soon_query = "
    SELECT b.Title, c.DueDate, DATEDIFF(c.DueDate, CURDATE()) as days_left
    FROM Circulation c
    INNER JOIN Holding h ON c.AccNo = h.AccNo
    INNER JOIN Books b ON h.CallNo = b.CallNo
    WHERE c.MemberNo = :member_no
    AND c.ReturnDate IS NULL
    AND DATEDIFF(c.DueDate, CURDATE()) BETWEEN 0 AND 3
    ORDER BY c.DueDate ASC
    LIMIT 2
";

// 3. Check for pending fines
if ($quick_stats['pending_fines'] > 0) {
    $notifications[] = [
        'type' => 'warning',
        'message' => 'You have pending fines of ‚Çπ' . $quick_stats['pending_fines'] .
            '. Please clear them at the circulation desk.'
    ];
}

// 4. Check for upcoming library events (within 7 days)
$events_query = "
    SELECT EventName, EventDate
    FROM LibraryEvents
    WHERE EventDate BETWEEN CURDATE() AND DATE_ADD(CURDATE(), INTERVAL 7 DAY)
    AND Status = 'Active'
    ORDER BY EventDate ASC
    LIMIT 1
";

// 5. Show success message if no issues
if (empty($notifications)) {
    $notifications[] = [
        'type' => 'success',
        'message' => 'All good! You have no overdue books or pending fines.
            Keep up the great reading!'
    ];
}
```

**Features:**

- **Overdue Books:** Shows count of overdue books with warning
- **Due Soon:** Shows specific books due in 0-3 days with titles
- **Pending Fines:** Shows exact fine amount (‚Çπ)
- **Upcoming Events:** Shows next event within 7 days from LibraryEvents table
- **Success Message:** Shows positive message if no issues
