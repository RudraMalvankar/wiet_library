## üéØ **QR Code Implementation Status**

### Database Ready
‚úÖ `Student.QRCode` field exists (VARCHAR(255))  
‚úÖ Can store QR code file path or data URL  
‚úÖ QR generation library available at `/libs/phpqrcode/`

### What's Needed for QR Codes
1. **Generate QR on Student Creation**
   - Use PRN or MemberNo as QR data
   - Save QR image to `/storage/qrcodes/student_[MemberNo].png`
   - Store file path in `Student.QRCode` field

2. **Display QR in Student Card**
   - Show QR code in member card view
   - Allow download/print of QR code
   - QR can contain: PRN, MemberNo, Name, Branch

3. **QR Scanner Integration** (Optional Enhancement)
   - Scan QR to quickly search student
   - Use for attendance/library entry
   - Mobile app integration ready

### Implementation Example
```php
// In API when creating student
require_once '../../libs/phpqrcode/phpqrcode.php';

$qrData = "PRN:{$prn}|Member:{$memberNo}|Name:{$name}";
$qrFilePath = "../../storage/qrcodes/student_{$memberNo}.png";
QRcode::png($qrData, $qrFilePath, 'L', 4, 2);

// Save path to database
$stmt = $pdo->prepare("UPDATE Student SET QRCode = ? WHERE StudentID = ?");
$stmt->execute([$qrFilePath, $studentId]);
```
