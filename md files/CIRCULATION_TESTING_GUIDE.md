## Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue: "Member not found" but member exists

**Solution:** Check the API endpoint:
- Open browser DevTools (F12)
- Go to Network tab
- Search member again
- Check the API call to `api/members.php?action=get&memberNo=XXX`
- Verify response format
- Check if Member table has the record

### Issue: Camera not working

**Solution:**
- Check if you're using HTTPS or localhost (required for camera access)
- Check browser permissions (camera must be allowed)
- Try **Simulate Scan** buttons instead

### Issue: Issue button stays disabled

**Solution:**
- Check browser console for JavaScript errors
- Verify both `selectedMember` and `selectedBook` are not null
- Check that book Status is exactly "Available" (case-sensitive)

### Issue: Statistics not updating

**Solution:**
- Check browser console for errors
- Verify API endpoint `api/circulation.php?action=stats` returns correct data
- Check that `loadStatistics()` function is being called after issue/return

### Issue: Fine calculation wrong

**Solution:**
- Verify system date is correct
- Check that DueDate in database is in correct format (YYYY-MM-DD)
- Fine is â‚¹2 per day, calculated as: `(Today - DueDate) Ã— 2`

## Sample Test Data

You can use this SQL to create test data:

```sql
-- Insert test member
INSERT INTO Member (MemberNo, MemberName, `Group`, Status, BooksIssued)
VALUES ('TEST001', 'Test User', 'Student', 'Active', 0);

-- Insert test book (if not exists)
INSERT INTO Books (CatNo, Title, Author1, Publisher, Year)
VALUES ('TESTCAT001', 'Test Book', 'Test Author', 'Test Publisher', '2024');

-- Insert test holding (available)
INSERT INTO Holding (CatNo, AccNo, Status, Location)
VALUES ('TESTCAT001', 'TESTACC001', 'Available', 'Test Section');

-- Insert test holding (issued) for return testing
INSERT INTO Holding (CatNo, AccNo, Status, Location)
VALUES ('TESTCAT001', 'TESTACC002', 'Issued', 'Test Section');

-- Insert active circulation for return testing
INSERT INTO Circulation (AccNo, MemberNo, IssueDate, DueDate, AdminID, Status)
VALUES ('TESTACC002', 'TEST001', DATE_SUB(NOW(), INTERVAL 10 DAY), DATE_ADD(NOW(), INTERVAL 5 DAY), 1, 'Issued');

-- Update member's BooksIssued count
UPDATE Member SET BooksIssued = 1 WHERE MemberNo = 'TEST001';
```

## Performance Checks

1. **API Response Time:**
   - Open DevTools â†’ Network tab
   - Trigger searches
   - API calls should complete in < 500ms

2. **Camera Initialization:**
   - Start Scan should activate camera in < 2 seconds
   - If slower, check camera resolution settings

3. **Page Load:**
   - Initial page load should be < 3 seconds
   - Statistics, active circulations, and return history should load in parallel

---

## Next Steps After Testing

If all tests pass:

1. âœ… **Issue Books workflow fully functional**
2. âœ… **Return Books workflow fully functional**
3. âœ… **Scanning infrastructure operational**
4. âœ… **Live data updates working**

You can proceed to:
- Train staff on using the system
- Generate QR codes for existing holdings (use `database/tools/batch_generate_qr.php`)
- Configure fine rates in settings
- Set up reports generation
- Implement soft delete for books
- Add notification system

## Quick Reference - Keyboard Shortcuts

- **Ctrl+K** - Open Quick Scan modal (fast lookup anywhere)
- **Enter** - Submit search in input fields
- **Tab** - Navigate between form fields
- **Esc** - Close modals

**Happy Testing! ðŸŽ‰**

All circulation features are now ready for production use.
